## Some Features

* **Easy UI** </br>
The UI of the website is supereasy to use and consists of required help-texts and visual feedback.
* **Filters** </br>
Fetch required record easily using filters like date, name and diagnosis.
* **Profile Update functionality**</br>
You can create a profile and personalize it in your own way by changing username, state and all kinds of normal stuffs.
* **CRUD functionality**</br>
User can add,delete,create and view records.
* **JWT authentication**</br>
In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned and must be saved locally (typically in local storage, but cookies can be also used), instead of the traditional approach of creating a session in the server and returning a cookie.
